<h1 align="center">Could This Be Useful to You?</h1>
<p>There's an ISSUES.md file that is a brain dump of most of the issues I encountered working on this project. There's also a DEVNOTES.md file that is a kind of a plan, todo, brain dump of my process. Dubious usefulness all round.</p>
<h1 align="center">Getting Started</h1>
- Bootstrapped with Vite so:
  
  - clone it
  - `npm i`
  - `npm run dev`

<h1 align="center">Help!</h1>
<p>Feel free to contact me with questions!</p>
